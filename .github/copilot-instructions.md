## 3. Project Overview & Core Components

**EngLog** is a system designed to facilitate the collection, processing, and analysis of user journals using AI.

### Target Architecture (To Be Designed)

The system will be architected around three main components:

1.  **API Server (Go):** A robust backend service responsible for collecting and storing user journals securely. It will serve as the primary interface for clients.
2.  **Worker Service (Go):** An AI-powered processing engine that enriches journal entries. It will perform tasks like sentiment analysis, insight generation, and contextualization. This service will operate asynchronously.
3.  **Web Application:** An intuitive user interface that allows users to view their journals, explore AI-generated insights, and interact with the system.

## 4. Architecture Documentation Reference

**IMPORTANT:** The project now has comprehensive modular architecture documentation located in `docs/architecture/`.

**Before making any architectural decisions or implementing code, you must:**

1. **Start with the main index:** [`docs/architecture/README.md`](../docs/architecture/README.md) - This provides a complete catalog and navigation guide for all architecture documents.

2. **Review the executive overview:** [`docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`](../docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md) - Contains high-level business objectives, system context, and architectural overview.

3. **Understand the core components:**

   - [`docs/architecture/components/API_SERVICE.md`](../docs/architecture/components/API_SERVICE.md) - Detailed REST and gRPC API design
   - [`docs/architecture/components/WORKER_POOL.md`](../docs/architecture/components/WORKER_POOL.md) - Distributed processing architecture
   - [`docs/architecture/components/DATABASE.md`](../docs/architecture/components/DATABASE.md) - PostgreSQL schema and storage strategies
   - [`docs/architecture/components/WEB_APPLICATION.md`](../docs/architecture/components/WEB_APPLICATION.md) - Frontend architecture

4. **Check design specifications:**

   - [`docs/architecture/design/AUTHENTICATION.md`](../docs/architecture/design/AUTHENTICATION.md) - OAuth 2.0, OTP, and security strategies

5. **Review operational guidelines:**
   - [`docs/architecture/operations/DEPLOYMENT.md`](../docs/architecture/operations/DEPLOYMENT.md) - Deployment strategies and infrastructure
   - [`docs/architecture/operations/SECURITY.md`](../docs/architecture/operations/SECURITY.md) - Security considerations and implementation
   - [`docs/architecture/operations/TESTING.md`](../docs/architecture/operations/TESTING.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy

**All architectural decisions, code implementations, and technical choices must align with the specifications in these documents.** Use them as the definitive reference for system design, patterns, and implementation details.

## 5. Project Planning & Development Roadmap

**IMPORTANT:** The project planning and task management is organized in `docs/planning/`.

**Before starting any development work, you must:**

1. **Review the development roadmap:** [`docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`](../docs/planning/ROADMAP.md) - Contains the complete 6-phase development plan from Phase 0 (Dev Prototype) through Phase 5 (Enterprise Scale). Understand which phase the project is currently in and the specific objectives and scope for that phase.

2. **Check current task assignments:**

   - [`docs/planning/backlog/`](../docs/planning/backlog/) - **Phase 0 (Dev Prototype) Tasks**: Contains 9 prototype tasks (PROTOTYPE-001 through PROTOTYPE-009) for the simplified development version with in-memory storage, direct Ollama integration, and manual testing. Includes comprehensive README.md with task dependencies and development sequence.
   - [`docs/planning/in-progress/`](../docs/planning/in-progress/) - **Active Development**: Tasks currently being implemented
   - [`docs/planning/done/`](../docs/planning/done/) - **Completed Tasks**: Successfully implemented and tested features
   - [`docs/planning/canceled/`](../docs/planning/canceled/) - **Canceled Tasks**: Discontinued or superseded features

3. **Understand task prioritization:**

   - **Current Phase**: Phase 0 (Dev Prototype) - Focus on rapid concept validation
   - **Core Dependencies**: PROTOTYPE-001 (basic API) ‚Üí PROTOTYPE-002 (journal endpoints) ‚Üí AI integration tasks
   - **Success Criteria**: Journal creation, AI analysis via Ollama, data retrieval, system health monitoring

4. **Task Implementation Guidelines:**
   - Follow the Phase 0 scope: No authentication, in-memory storage, synchronous processing
   - Prioritize simplicity and speed over production readiness
   - Each task has clear acceptance criteria and technical specifications
   - Manual testing with curl/Postman examples instead of automated tests

**All development work must align with the current phase objectives and task specifications.** Do not implement features from future phases unless explicitly requested.

## 6. Proposed Technology Stack

The following technology stack is proposed as a starting point for the architecture. You are expected to evaluate, refine, and justify these choices in the architecture document.

- **Backend Language:** Go 1.24+
- **API Framework:** Gin (to be evaluated)
- **Database:** NoSQL (Postgres).
- **Inter-service Communication:** gRPC for communication between the API and Worker services.
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose for local development and deployment.
- **Cloud Provider:** To be determined (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

---

## 7. Key Design Principles (Mandatory)

All architectural decisions and code implementation must adhere to these principles:

- **Clean Architecture:** Enforce a clear separation of concerns between domain logic, application logic, and infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** Design all components to be horizontally scalable and stateless where possible.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices from the start (e.g., data encryption, secure authentication, input validation).
- **Testability:** Ensure all code is written to be easily testable, with a comprehensive strategy covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Observability:** Plan for structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing from day one.
- **API-First Design:** Define API contracts (e.g., using OpenAPI for REST or Protobuf for gRPC) before implementation to ensure clear communication between services.
- **Simplicity and Evolutionary Design (YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Start with the simplest possible solution that works. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering. The architecture should be designed to evolve and accommodate complexity as required, not before.
- **üö® CRITICAL Go Coding Rule:** **NEVER use `interface{}` in any code.** Always use `any` (Go 1.18+) instead. This is a mandatory coding standard for all Go code in this project. The `any` keyword is the modern, readable alias for `interface{}` and must be used consistently throughout the codebase.

## 8. Development Workflow

This project will follow an evolutionary, architecture-aware development model. The goal is to establish a solid but flexible foundation that can adapt as the project grows.

1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Architecture & Design (Future Phase)**

    - Create the initial System Architecture Document, focusing on core components, boundaries, and key decisions.
    - Define the initial API contracts (gRPC/Protobuf) and core domain models.
    - Set up the project structure, CI/CD pipeline, and development environment.

2.  **Phase 2: Iterative Implementation**

    - Develop the core components based on the approved architecture.
    - Implement a comprehensive test suite.

3.  **Phase 3: Deployment & Operation**
    - Deploy the system to the chosen cloud environment.
    - Implement monitoring and alerting.

This document will be updated as the project evolves. Let's begin this exciting journey!
