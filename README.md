# englog

Welcome to **englog**, a project built through a unique collaboration between a human developer and an artificial intelligence assistant. Our goal is to create an exceptional product by combining human creativity with AI-driven development.

## Vision

**englog** is a system designed to empower users by helping them collect, process, and analyze their personal journals using the power of artificial intelligence. By transforming daily entries into structured insights, we aim to provide a tool for self-reflection and personal growth.

This repository is a living testament to a new way of building software, where human-AI partnership is at the core of the creative process.

## Core Components

The system is architected around three main components:

1.  **API (Go):** A robust backend service responsible for collecting and storing user journals securely in a NoSQL database.
2.  **Worker (Go):** An AI-powered processing engine that enriches journal entries by performing tasks like sentiment analysis, insight generation, and contextualization.
3.  **Web Application:** An intuitive user interface that allows users to view their journals, explore AI-generated insights, and interact with the system.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Go
*   **Database:** NoSQL (Specifics to be determined)
*   **Frontend:** (To be determined)
*   **Infrastructure:** Cloud-native, containerized deployment (details to follow).

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. Instructions for setup and deployment will be added as the components are built.

## Contribution

This project follows a unique human-AI collaborative model. All contributions are a result of the synergy between the human project lead and the AI assistant.
