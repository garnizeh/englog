**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-008
**Feature_Name:** Testing and Validation
**Task_Title:** Create Manual Testing Documentation and API Examples
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (August 6, 2025)

**SUMMARY:** Complete manual testing documentation created with 20+ use cases, Bruno collection references, comprehensive curl examples, and real-world validation using Docker environment. All API endpoints documented with successful/error scenarios and performance data.

**Task_Description:**
Create comprehensive documentation and examples for manual testing of the prototype API using tools like curl, Postman, or Bruno. This includes providing ready-to-use API request examples, expected responses, and a testing workflow that validates all functionality. The documentation should enable any developer to quickly test and validate the prototype without requiring a frontend interface.

**✅ CURRENT STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Implementation Summary:**

- **Primary Documentation**: `/docs/hands-on/PROTOTYPE-005-USE-CASES.md` (1100+ lines of comprehensive testing documentation)
- **Bruno Collection**: `/bruno-collection/` - Complete API collection with 15+ requests, organized folders, and documentation
- **Quick Start**: `README.md` contains basic curl examples for immediate testing
- **Docker Testing**: `/docs/hands-on/DOCKER.md` provides containerized testing environment with examples
- **Validation**: Successfully tested with Docker environment showing functional AI processing

**Available Resources:**

1. **20+ Use Cases**: Complete API coverage from UC-001 (Health Check) to UC-020 (Advanced AI Processing)
2. **Bruno Collection**: Organized folder structure for API client import
3. **Real Examples**: Actual API responses from working Docker environment
4. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling examples
5. **Performance Data**: Measured response times (1-3s for AI processing, <100ms for basic operations)
