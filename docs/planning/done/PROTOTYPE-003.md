**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-003
**Feature_Name:** Ollama AI Integration
**Task_Title:** Implement Direct Ollama Integration for AI Processing Validation

**Task_Description:**
Create a direct integration with Ollama for two key AI processing validations: sentiment analysis of journal entries and structured journal entry generation from prompts. This should be a simple HTTP client that communicates with a local Ollama instance for both processing and generation tasks. The integration should be synchronous and straightforward, without complex abstraction layers, to quickly validate both AI analysis and content creation capabilities.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

**Sentiment Analysis Validation:**

- [x] HTTP client can communicate with local Ollama instance for sentiment analysis
- [x] Basic prompt is crafted for sentiment analysis of journal content
- [x] Ollama response is parsed and structured into sentiment data
- [x] Processing results include sentiment score, label, and confidence level

**Journal Generation Validation:**

- [x] AI can generate well-structured journal entries from simple prompts
- [x] Generated entries include comprehensive metadata (mood, tags, themes, entities)
- [x] Generated content follows standardized JSON structure optimized for future vectorization
- [x] Entries include semantic markers and key phrases for embedding preparation
- [x] Generated structure supports both current processing and future semantic search
- [x] Content includes emotional context and thematic elements ready for Phase 2 evolution
- [x] Generated entries follow a standardized format suitable for immediate processing and future AI enhancement

**Common Requirements:**

- [x] Integration handles Ollama API errors gracefully for both operations
- [x] Simple retry mechanism for failed API calls (max 3 attempts)
- [x] Processing time is logged for performance monitoring
- [x] Configuration allows setting Ollama endpoint URL
- [x] Basic validation ensures inputs are suitable for processing

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** Ollama HTTP Client, AI Processing Service, AI Generation Service
- **API Endpoint(s):** Internal service calls to Ollama (typically localhost:11434)
- **Data Model(s):**
  - SentimentResult struct with Score, Label, Confidence fields
  - GeneratedJournal struct with:
    - Content (structured text optimized for semantic analysis)
    - Metadata (mood, emotional_context, themes, entities, key_phrases)
    - SemanticMarkers (prepared for future embedding generation)
    - ProcessingHints (optimization flags for Phase 2 vectorization)
- **Key Logic:**
  - Prompt engineering for sentiment analysis
  - Prompt engineering for structured journal generation
  - Response parsing for both analysis and generation
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Processing time <10 seconds per operation, 90%+ success rate with local Ollama

**Dependencies:**

- Requires local Ollama installation and running instance
- PROTOTYPE-002: Journal endpoints must exist to provide content for processing

**Reference_Implementation:**

- See https://github.com/ardanlabs/ai-training/blob/main/cmd/examples/example5/main.go for practical Ollama API usage patterns and HTTP client implementation examples
