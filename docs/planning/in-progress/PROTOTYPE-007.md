**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-007
**Feature_Name:** Development Docker Setup
**Task_Title:** Create Optional Docker Configuration for Development Isolation
**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED** (August 6, 2025)

**SUMMARY:** Complete Docker configuration created with production and development environments, Ollama integration, hot-reload capabilities, automated setup scripts, and comprehensive documentation. Successfully tested with running containers and functional AI processing.

**Task_Description:**
Create an optional Docker configuration that allows developers to run the prototype in an isolated container environment. This should include a simple Dockerfile for the Go application and a docker-compose.yml that orchestrates the API server with a local Ollama instance. This enables consistent development environments and simplifies testing without requiring local Ollama installation.

**âœ… CURRENT STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Implementation Summary:**

- **Docker Configuration**: Complete multi-stage Dockerfile for Go application with optimized Alpine-based image
- **Development Environment**: `docker-compose.dev.yml` with hot-reload capabilities for rapid development
- **Production Environment**: `docker-compose.yml` for production deployment
- **Automated Setup**: `scripts/docker-setup.sh` for one-command environment setup with multiple options
- **Container Orchestration**: Proper service dependencies, health checks, and network configuration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Docker setup guide in README.md with troubleshooting
- **Validation**: Successfully tested with functional containers, AI processing, and API endpoints

**Available Resources:**

1. **Multi-Environment Setup**: Both development (hot-reload) and production configurations
2. **Automated Scripts**: One-command setup with customizable model selection
3. **Service Integration**: Ollama + API with proper networking and health checks
4. **Volume Management**: Persistent data storage and efficient development mounting
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured JSON logging accessible through docker compose logs

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [x] Dockerfile builds the Go application successfully
- [x] Docker-compose.yml includes both API server and Ollama service
- [x] Application runs correctly inside Docker container
- [x] Ollama service is accessible from the API container
- [x] Environment variables are properly configured for container communication
- [x] Development files can be mounted for hot-reload (optional)
- [x] Container logs are accessible and properly formatted
- [x] Services start in correct order (Ollama before API)
- [x] Documentation explains how to run the Docker setup
- [x] Docker setup is optional and doesn't block non-Docker development

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** Docker Configuration, Container Orchestration âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **API Endpoint(s):** Same endpoints but accessible through Docker network âœ… VERIFIED
- **Data Model(s):** Same models but configured for container environment âœ… CONFIRMED
- **Key Logic:** Multi-container orchestration, service discovery, environment configuration âœ… FUNCTIONAL
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Container startup time <30 seconds, reliable service communication âœ… ACHIEVED

**Implementation Details:**

âœ… **Multi-Stage Dockerfile**: Optimized build with golang:1.24-alpine and alpine:latest runtime
âœ… **Development Environment**: docker-compose.dev.yml with hot-reload and volume mounting
âœ… **Production Environment**: docker-compose.yml for production deployment
âœ… **Automated Setup**: scripts/docker-setup.sh with dev/prod modes and model configuration
âœ… **Service Discovery**: Proper networking between API and Ollama services
âœ… **Health Checks**: Container health verification for reliable startup
âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guide in README.md with troubleshooting
âœ… **Security**: Non-root user execution and secure container practices

**Dependencies:**

- âœ… PROTOTYPE-003: Ollama integration must be functional to test in Docker (SATISFIED)
- âœ… PROTOTYPE-001: Basic API server must exist to containerize (SATISFIED)

**Estimated_Effort:** Small âœ… COMPLETED

**Final Implementation Status:**

ðŸŽ¯ **TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

All Docker infrastructure has been implemented and verified:

- Multi-environment Docker setup (development + production)
- Automated setup scripts with model configuration
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guide
- Service orchestration with proper health checks and networking
- Full integration with existing prototype API and AI processing

The Docker setup provides a complete containerized environment that enhances development workflow while maintaining compatibility with non-Docker development approaches.
