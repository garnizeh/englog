**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-006
**Feature_Name:** Debugging and Observability
**Task_Title:** Implement Structured Logging and Request/Response Debugging

**Task_Description:**
Implement comprehensive structured logging throughout the application to enable efficient debugging of the processing flow and API interactions. This includes logging all incoming requests, AI processing steps, timing information, and any errors that occur. The logging should be structured to enable easy analysis while providing immediate visibility into system behavior during development and testing.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [ ] Structured logging is implemented throughout the application
- [ ] All HTTP requests and responses are logged with timestamps
- [ ] AI processing steps are logged with timing and results
- [ ] Error conditions are logged with full context and stack traces
- [ ] Log levels are configurable (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- [ ] Request IDs are generated and tracked through the entire request lifecycle
- [ ] Processing duration is measured and logged for performance analysis
- [ ] Logs include enough information to reproduce and debug issues
- [ ] Log format is consistent and easily readable
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged (if any exists in future)

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** Logging Infrastructure, Request Middleware
- **API Endpoint(s):** Logging applies to all endpoints
- **Data Model(s):** Log entry structures with timestamps, levels, and context
- **Key Logic:** Request/response logging middleware, performance timing, error context capture
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Logging overhead <5ms per request, configurable log levels, clear log format

**Dependencies:**

- PROTOTYPE-001: Basic API server for adding logging middleware
- Can be developed in parallel with other tasks

**Estimated_Effort:** Small
