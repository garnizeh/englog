**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-004
**Feature_Name:** Synchronous AI Processing
**Task_Title:** Implement In-Memory Worker for Synchronous Journal Processing

**Task_Description:**
Create a simple in-memory worker system that automatically processes journal entries when they are created, performing sentiment analysis and storing the results alongside the original journal data. This should be a synchronous process that completes before the API response is returned, providing immediate feedback on the AI processing capabilities without the complexity of asynchronous job queues.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [ ] Journal creation triggers automatic AI processing
- [ ] Processing happens synchronously within the POST /journals request
- [ ] AI results are stored in memory alongside journal data
- [ ] GET /journals/{id} returns both journal content and AI analysis results
- [ ] Processing failures don't prevent journal creation (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Processing status is tracked (pending, completed, failed)
- [ ] Simple worker interface allows for easy testing and debugging
- [ ] Processing results include timestamp and processing duration
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback when AI processing fails

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** In-Memory Worker, AI Processing Pipeline
- **API Endpoint(s):** Enhanced `POST /journals` and `GET /journals/{id}` with AI results
- **Data Model(s):** Enhanced Journal struct with ProcessingResult field containing sentiment analysis
- **Key Logic:** Synchronous processing workflow, in-memory result storage, error handling with fallback
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Total request time including AI processing <15 seconds, graceful failure handling

**Dependencies:**

- PROTOTYPE-003: Ollama integration must be functional
- PROTOTYPE-002: Journal endpoints must be established

**Estimated_Effort:** Medium
