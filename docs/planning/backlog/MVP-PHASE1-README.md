- **P1 (High):** Essential features for user experience
- **P2 (Medium):** Important but not blocking for MVP launch

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Database Migration Complexity:** Start with simple schema, iterate
2. **gRPC Worker Coordination:** Use battle-tested patterns
3. **OAuth Integration:** Start with single provider, expand
4. **Frontend Complexity:** Keep vanilla JS simple, avoid over-engineering

### Timeline Risks

1. **Scope Creep:** Strict adherence to MVP scope
2. **Integration Complexity:** Early integration testing
3. **AI Service Dependencies:** Robust fallback mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- All critical path tasks (P0) completed
- 80%+ test coverage achieved
- API response times < 500ms
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics

- Functional authentication flow
- Complete journal CRUD operations
- AI insights generation working
- User feedback collection ready
