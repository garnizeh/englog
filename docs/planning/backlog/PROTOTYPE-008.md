**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-008
**Feature_Name:** Testing and Validation
**Task_Title:** Create Manual Testing Documentation and API Examples

**Task_Description:**
Create comprehensive documentation and examples for manual testing of the prototype API using tools like curl, Postman, or Bruno. This includes providing ready-to-use API request examples, expected responses, and a testing workflow that validates all functionality. The documentation should enable any developer to quickly test and validate the prototype without requiring a frontend interface.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [ ] Complete curl examples for all API endpoints are provided
- [ ] JSON request/response examples are documented with proper formatting
- [ ] Testing workflow documentation guides through complete validation process
- [ ] Examples include both successful and error scenarios
- [ ] Postman/Bruno collection is provided for easy import (optional)
- [ ] Documentation explains how to verify AI processing results
- [ ] Performance testing examples show how to measure response times
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide helps debug common issues
- [ ] Examples demonstrate the complete journal creation and analysis flow
- [ ] Documentation is clear enough for non-technical stakeholders to test

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** Documentation, Testing Examples, API Validation
- **API Endpoint(s):** All endpoints have documented testing examples
- **Data Model(s):** Example JSON data for all supported operations
- **Key Logic:** Complete testing workflow, validation procedures, example data sets
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Clear documentation, copy-paste ready examples, comprehensive test coverage

**Dependencies:**

- PROTOTYPE-002: Journal endpoints must exist to document
- PROTOTYPE-004: AI processing must be functional to provide complete examples

**Estimated_Effort:** Small
