**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-007
**Feature_Name:** Development Docker Setup
**Task_Title:** Create Optional Docker Configuration for Development Isolation

**Task_Description:**
Create an optional Docker configuration that allows developers to run the prototype in an isolated container environment. This should include a simple Dockerfile for the Go application and a docker-compose.yml that orchestrates the API server with a local Ollama instance. This enables consistent development environments and simplifies testing without requiring local Ollama installation.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [ ] Dockerfile builds the Go application successfully
- [ ] Docker-compose.yml includes both API server and Ollama service
- [ ] Application runs correctly inside Docker container
- [ ] Ollama service is accessible from the API container
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured for container communication
- [ ] Development files can be mounted for hot-reload (optional)
- [ ] Container logs are accessible and properly formatted
- [ ] Services start in correct order (Ollama before API)
- [ ] Documentation explains how to run the Docker setup
- [ ] Docker setup is optional and doesn't block non-Docker development

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** Docker Configuration, Container Orchestration
- **API Endpoint(s):** Same endpoints but accessible through Docker network
- **Data Model(s):** Same models but configured for container environment
- **Key Logic:** Multi-container orchestration, service discovery, environment configuration
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Container startup time <30 seconds, reliable service communication

**Dependencies:**

- PROTOTYPE-003: Ollama integration must be functional to test in Docker
- PROTOTYPE-001: Basic API server must exist to containerize

**Estimated_Effort:** Small
