**Task_ID:** PROTOTYPE-009
**Feature_Name:** Health and Status Monitoring
**Task_Title:** Implement Basic Health Check and Status Endpoints

**Task_Description:**
Add essential health check and status monitoring endpoints to the prototype API to enable validation of system status, including API health, Ollama connectivity, memory usage, and processed journal statistics. These endpoints are crucial for debugging and monitoring the prototype during development and demonstration.

**Acceptance_Criteria:**

- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns basic API health status
- [ ] `/status` endpoint shows system information (uptime, memory usage, journal count)
- [ ] `/status/ollama` endpoint verifies Ollama connectivity and model availability
- [ ] Health checks include response time measurements
- [ ] Status endpoints return proper HTTP status codes (200, 503)
- [ ] JSON responses follow consistent format across all monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Memory usage statistics show current utilization
- [ ] Processed journal statistics show total count and processing times
- [ ] Error handling provides clear diagnostic information
- [ ] Endpoints are accessible without authentication (for prototype simplicity)

**Technical_Specifications:**

- **Component(s):** HTTP handlers, system monitoring, connectivity checks
- **API Endpoint(s):** `GET /health`, `GET /status`, `GET /status/ollama`
- **Data Model(s):** HealthResponse, StatusResponse, OllamaStatusResponse structs
- **Key Logic:** System health validation, Ollama connectivity test, memory statistics collection
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Fast response times (<100ms), reliable status reporting

**Dependencies:**

- PROTOTYPE-001: Basic API foundation required
- PROTOTYPE-003: Ollama integration needed for connectivity checks

**Estimated_Effort:** Small
